ETERNAL STRIKER Rr M5 CORE2
T.KATAKOTO (TETUBUN-HO) TEAM Redherring(STUDIO Sequence) 

for M5 Stack CORE2

Works that ported STG(shooting game) [ETERNAL STRIKER Rr], which was operating in MIDP environment.
There is no sound due to rights. (Currently, it may not sound well).

I have customized TFT_eSprite.

ガラケー前期、Doja2.1-3.0、あるいはMIDP時代に作った作品 [ETERNAL STRIKER Rr]の移植作です。
権利の関係上もありサウンドは有りません。（現状上手く鳴らないという事もあります）

TFT_eSpriteをカスタマイズして使っています。
